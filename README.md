Analyze Network Information CSV

February 2019 NPL Challenge

This is my script developed for the February 2019 NPL challenge to read a CSV inventory generated by NMSaaS with end-of-list information.
Overall the challenge requirements are:
	Create a summary of the information including Vendor, Device Model, Software Version, Device End of Support Date. 
	
  Input - Filename of the inventory file. This can be either a CSV or an Excel sheet.
  
  Output -  Excel sheet (name provied on screen) with:
				Tab sorting the output by count total 
				Tab sorting the output by end of support date
				Tab with various statistics on the device counts
